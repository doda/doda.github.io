- **Some code matters, some doesn't**
  Some code in your app will be performance critical, or read frequently, or even changed frequently. Some will become a fundamental building block. Other code will be squared away and hidden forever to be executed by the computer in rote repetition, never to be gazed at by humans ever again. Knowing where whatever you are working on right now falls on this spectrum can allow you to cut some corners.

- **Get the gestalt right**
  From Andrej's ["Survival Guide to a PhD"](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/). Good engineers often use heuristics when looking at your code.
