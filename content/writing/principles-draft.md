- Become aware of your attachment style. If insecure, it might be driving a lot of things in life:
  - Anxious: People-pleasing, self-blame, difficulty saying no, swinging between over-giving and resentment.
  - Avoidant: Inability to commit to jobs, places, people, lone-wolf streak, running away when things get difficult, need for high levels of autonomy, undervaluing the emotional lens.
