I work on Systems at [Substack](https://substack.com). You can see some of what I've worked on on my [resume](). I am super excited about all things infrastructure engineering, machine learning and running things at scale.


My journey has taken me to living in 10+ cities and visiting 50+ countries, from early startup work in London and Berlin to settling in San Francisco.


In my free time I enjoy being, meditation, jhanas, CrossFit, painting and circling. I care deeply that what I do positively affects those around me. 


I'm usually at the Thursday sits at the [Berkeley Alembic](https://www.berkeleyalembic.org/).  If our paths cross in meaningful ways, don't hesitate to reach out!
